I have two prior lectures that delve into detail about assembly language, and analyzing disassembly:
* [Assembly Language Crash Course pt. 1]({% post_url 2017-02-09-asm-crash-course-1 %})
* [Assembly Language Crash Course pt. 2]({% post_url 2017-02-14-asm-crash-course-2 %})

## Additional Resources

### Ghidra
In addition to the resources discussed in the above two posts, one tool that we will use for analyzing
disassembly is [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), which was released last year. This has become very popular
over the course of the prior year, and we will be performing many of the examples using this instead of
IDA Free.

### Hopper
Another popular disassembler is [Hopper](https://www.hopperapp.com/), which is named after the famous Rear
Admiral [Grace Murray Hopper](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Grace-Hopper), a legendary female computer
scientist in the Navy, who pioneered work in compilers and the first compiled computer languages.
