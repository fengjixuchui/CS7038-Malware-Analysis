For forensic analysis and host exploitation (attack simulation), here are lectures covering the bulk of this topic:
* [Building an Attack]({% post_url 2020-01-20-building-an-attack %})
* [Using Metasploit and Pupy RAT]({% post_url 2020-01-21-metasploit-and-pupy %})
* [Static Analysis of Compromised Host]({% post_url 2020-01-24-static-analysis-host %})
* [Analysis Exercise]({% post_url 2020-01-28-analysis-exercise %})

The first two lectures demonstrate using some common offensive tools to compromise a VM. In particular, the PupyRAT
malware is both open source and alleged to be used by [many](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/iranian-pupyrat-bites-middle-eastern-organizations)
[countries'](https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2020-0123.pdf)
[intelligence services](https://summit.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/summit/cds-2019/presentations/cds19-executive-s08-achievement-unlocked.pdf)
for cyber espionage, making it a great real-world candidate for analysis.

The second two modules cover analysis of VMs, the last of which is a follow-along type of exercise.
