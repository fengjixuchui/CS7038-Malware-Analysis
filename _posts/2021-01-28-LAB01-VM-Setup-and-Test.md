During the first module, we covered using VirtualBox to import, snapshot, and configure networking on the Kali VM. I have configured a Win7 VM that is
linked in the assignment. The VM is configured to use host-only networking and already has `ncat.exe` installed. Alternately, you may use any of
the Windows VMs available from [Microsoft's Modern.IE](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/) or even the educational
version available for free to students. You
will need to disable the Windows Firewall, as well as disable Windows Defender, to ensure that these features do not interfere with your work. You
will also need to install `ncat` yourself, from the ZIP file linked in [the first lecture notes]({% post_url 2021-01-13-course-introduction %}).

This independent lab will have you achieve the following goals - you'll want to use (`tcpdump -w` as was demoed in the video, on the Kali VM, to
capture the traffic):

Configure the networking to use Host-Only Network on both VMs, with Win7 using the same VirtualBox/vboxnet host network that Kali is configured to use.
* a) Ensure that you can run both VMs, and try to ping one VM to the other, identifying the pings are responded to
* b) Use `ncat.exe` on the Windows system as a listener (-l, -p  options) and connect to it from the Kali VM, and type a short message across the connection that includes your UC username
* c) Use `ncat.exe` on the Windows system, as a listener, and use `cmd.exe`, `python.exe` to create a simple remote shell that you connect to from your Kali VM.
Use this channel to write a new file named "myoutput.txt" onto the Windows 7's Desktop, and this file may contain whatever you want, but needs to at least contain your username.

Attach a ZIP file containing the PCAP generated by `tcpdump`, and also the `output.txt` file, as the submission for this assignment.
Method #2 from [This Example](https://www.petri.com/quickly_create_txt_file_from_cmd)
might be helpful if you're using `cmd.exe` and want a tip on how to accomplish the file write operation without a GUI.
