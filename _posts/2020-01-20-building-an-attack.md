I have two prior lectures that each discuss classic attacks using two different Trojan Horse file formats: PDF and SWF.

Here are the links to the lecture materials as well as embedded videos. Please review the HTML content contained in these
as well, as there is very important detail there that isn't covered in the videos alone.

 Feel free to try both attacks out if you wish, however it won't be necessary to know the attacks inside and
 out for Tuesday. The key will be to familiarize yourself with the following concepts:
 * What are the tools that are used for building the attacks?
 * How are the different VMs used? (in some cases, we may augment the Kali VM with another Windows VM to control
the backdoor via a GUI)
 * What components (files) have to be created to pull off the attack?
 * What features in VirtualBox are helpful to me in demonstrating the attacks?
