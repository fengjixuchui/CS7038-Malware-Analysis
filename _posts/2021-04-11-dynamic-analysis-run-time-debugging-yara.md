This next module builds on the work done in Ghidra as well as VirtualBox to introduce both real-time analysis
of running malicious code, as well as using findings to hunt for the malware on a running system.

*Be advised that the below content is from the 2020 class, referencing timeframes for material covered which
is different from how the 2021 schedule for the class was organized.*

The lectures make reference to a malware artifact which I built that was distributed in 2020. As the link for
that is buried in lecture notes, I am providing another link for the `revolutions_backdoor_windows.exe`:
