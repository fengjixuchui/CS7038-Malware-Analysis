Thus, the list can only be active on\n one of the attached text fields at a time. This is usually the desired behavior, and it allows\n for one autocompleter to be reused on many fields. Behavior is undefined when multiple\n autocompleters are attached to the same text field. More likely, you should implement a\n composite model if you wish to present completions from multiple models on a single text field.\n \n By default, the autocompleter is activated when the user presses CTRL-SPACE, at which point, the\n model is queried for possible suggestions. The completer gives the model all the text preceding\n the current field\u0027s caret. This behavior can be changed by overriding the\n #getPrefix(JTextField) method. This may be useful, e.g., to obtain a prefix for\n the current word, rather than the full field contents, preceding the caret. The list is\n displayed such that its top-left corner is placed directly under the current field\u0027s caret. As\n the user continues typing, the suggestions are re-computed, and the list tracks with the caret.\n This positioning behavior can be modified by overriding the\n #getCompletionWindowPosition() method. As a convenience, the\n #getCaretPositionOnScreen(JTextField) method is available to compute the default\n position.\n \n Whether or not the list is currently displayed, when the user presses CTRL-SPACE, if only one\n completion is possible, it is automatically activated. This logic is applied again and again,\n until either no suggestions are given, or more than one suggestion is given (or until the\n autocompleter detects an infinite loop).
