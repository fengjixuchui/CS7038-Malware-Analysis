This is a rough syllabus for the course. Topics may change week to week
as I develop the curriculum further and in response to student feedback. Some scheduling

# Expectations

Students are expected to bring a laptop to class, and to have reviewed any assigned material
prior to Tuesday's class. It is recommended that students use their laptops for all classroom
lab work. However, if a student wishes to use another desktop system of their own to do the
work via remote access, this is permissable - but students will be on their own to ensure that
this functions adequately for classroom work.

# Scoring Rubric

The course will be presented in a self-study format where students will be expected
to study content created by and/or selected by the instructor ahead of Tuesday's class.
The concepts will then be reviewed in a hands-on instructor-led exercise during class,
where students will be able to ask questions and give input during the lecture and will
be expected to follow along with the exercise. This will give the students hands-on
experience with the subject matter, which then will be applied on Thursdays in class
for a graded assignment that is to be completed independently.

The contribution of each of these to your score will be as follows:

* **40%**: independent project assignments (4 of them)
* **30%**: weekly independent exercises building off instructor-led exercises
* **20%**: final project/lab
* **10%**: participation (in the form of quizzes and surveys)

# Online course

The course is intended to be attended in-class, and the self-study content to be kept up
with by students outside of class. The online content for the class will be hosted here,
while any assignments and grading will be managed using the university's new online
courseware named "Canvas" (and **no longer BlackBoard**). Students can access UC's canvas
at [https://uc.instructure.com](https://uc.instructure.com/).
